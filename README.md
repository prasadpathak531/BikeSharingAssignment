# BikeSharingAssignment

This project aims to analyze the demand pattern of bike sharing services using historical data, and develop a predictive model to forecast the demand for the future. The project was developed as a part of an assignment for a data science course.

### General Information
The bike sharing system is a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole process is automated. Anyone can rent a bike from a particular location and return it to a different location. The system keeps track of the bike availability at various locations, and users can check the availability and rent bikes accordingly. The data used in this project is from the Capital Bikeshare, a bike-sharing service in Washington, D.C., which has two types of users: registered and casual. The objective of this project is to analyze the demand pattern for the service and develop a predictive model to forecast the demand for the future.
#
#
### Conclusions
The demand for bike-sharing services is higher on working days and lower on weekends and holidays.
The demand for bike-sharing services is higher during rush hours, i.e., when people are going to or coming back from work.
The temperature, humidity, and wind speed have a significant impact on bike rental demand.
The random forest regression model is a good fit for predicting the bike rental demand, with an R-squared value of 0.93.
